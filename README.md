#### Code signing

As of Jan, 1, 2024, I am moving to signing commits with an SSH key instead of GPG keys.
My new signing key is stored as a FIDO2 credential on a yubikey, so it is very unlikely to change in the future.

New signing key below:

```
sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com AAAAGnNrLXNzaC1lZDI1NTE5QG9wZW5zc2guY29tAAAAILJfFjlHCkkfke9gevW9JsCGLZr506MnS9O4UfH9b6TrAAAAEXNzaDpnaC1raC1zaWduaW5n
```

My old GPG keys will stil be listed as valid on github to keep old commits from becoming unverified, but no new commits should be signed with them.
